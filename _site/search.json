The data lifecycle can be long and involve multiple people and thats why its important to work according to FAIR-principles.\nFAIR - Findable Accesible Interoperable and Reusable. Working according to this concept ensure that data collected for one question can be used for many more.\n\nThis relies on good data management practices where you work by research documentation, data organisation, information security, ethics and legislation.\n\nData is often not complete after first collection, first processing or first analysis. things are being added or moved between project altered as the work goes along. which makes it important to store data in a good system in a separate folder of raw-data which you dont touch.\n\nsome tips for good practice with documenting your data:\n\nDocument your methods and workflows.\nDocument where and when you downloaded data.\nDocument the versions of the software that you ran.\n\n\nOther things that we will practice later in the course is:\n\nEmploying version control via GIT\nShareable environments to make your scripts reproducible.\ncontainers to run scripts on other operating systems\nworkflow managers, that keep track of all of the above and also parse your data through the different scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also learned to set up this blog!\nQuarto allows you to write text and code into the same document and render into a few different formats such as webpages, blogs (!), docx and pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\nhere is a python example:\n\n\n# A simple Python example\ngreeting = \"Hello, world!\"\nprint(greeting)\n\nHello, world!\n\n# Some basic math\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntotal = sum(numbers)\nprint(f\"The sum is: {total}\")\n\nThe sum is: 15\n\n\n\nand this is a R example!\n\n\ndata(mtcars)\nhead(mtcars)\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n\nThatâ€™s all for today!"
