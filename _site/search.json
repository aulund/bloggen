    "text": "title: “Day 2 of MedBioInfo” date: 2025-10-07 categories: [medbioinfo, learning, data-science]\nWelcome back to my learning journey! Here are my reflections and key takeaways from day 2.\n\n\nToday we covered four main topics: - Introduction to environments - Quality control with Pixi and Slurm - Introduction to containers\n- Quality control with containers\n\n\n\nSince I work with variant visualisations, large datasets, and a mix of custom scripts and publication-ready figures it’s crucial that my toolchain is consistent and reproducible across systems and collaborators. Using Pixi (or another environment manager) keeps everything isolated and version-controlled, so I don’t end up with “it works on my computer” issues. Having a dedicated environment for each project makes it easier to share my setup — others can just clone the repository and get the exact same tools and versions. It also prevents older pipelines or scripts from breaking when dependencies update. When I prepare figures or analyses for papers, Pixi can help me keep track of software versions, channels, and dependencies — which makes the “Methods” section reproducible. Pixi supports multiple platforms and I can test everything locally and then run it on the cluster with minimal risk of environment mismatch.\n\n\n\nQuality control isn’t the most exciting part of bioinformatics, but it’s one of the most important. If the sequencing data is bad, everything that comes after will be unreliable. Running FastQC and MultiQC early on saves time later, even if the results themselves are pretty basic. It also makes me think more about how I organize things. Having a clear directory structure and running everything inside a controlled environment like Pixi helps keep track of what was actually done. It’s easy to lose that overview once the project grows. Working with SLURM and screen is a bit clunky at first, but it’s useful to understand how jobs run on the cluster. Being able to rerun things reproducibly — same data, same tools, same parameters — is really the main point.\n\n\n\nReproducibility is a constant problem in bioinformatics, and containers make it more manageable. They keep analyses stable even when systems or dependencies change. It’s also a practical way to share workflows without needing to explain every installation step. Building containers from scratch feels a bit advanced, but understanding how they work makes the overall workflow more reliable.\n\n*That’s all for today"

This diagram illustrates the core concepts of Nextflow including processes, channels, and how data flows through a computational pipeline.\n\n\nToday we ran our first Nextflow script:\n#!/usr/bin/env nextflow\n\nparams.greeting = 'Hello world!'\ngreeting_ch = Channel.of(params.greeting)\n\nprocess SPLITLETTERS {\n    input:\n    val x\n\n    output:\n    path 'chunk_*'\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    printf '$x' | split -b 6 - chunk_\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess CONVERTTOUPPER {\n    input:\n    path y\n\n    output:\n    stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    cat $y | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]' \n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n    letters_ch = SPLITLETTERS(greeting_ch)\n    results_ch = CONVERTTOUPPER(letters_ch.flatten())\n    results_ch.view{ it }\n}\nWhen we run this script:\nnextflow run hello.nf\nWe get this output:\nN E X T F L O W   ~  version 25.04.7\n\nLaunching `hello.nf` [jolly_faraday] DSL2 - revision: f5e335f983\n\nexecutor &gt;  local (3)\n[96/fd5f07] SPLITLETTERS (1)   [100%] 1 of 1 ✔\n[7e/dad424] CONVERTTOUPPER (2) [100%] 2 of 2 ✔\nHELLO \nWORLD!\nThis workflow demonstrates several key Nextflow concepts: - Channels: greeting_ch carries data between processes - SPLITLETTERS process: Uses split command to break text into 6-byte chunks - CONVERTTOUPPER process: Converts text to uppercase using tr command - Workflow: Connects processes with .flatten() to handle multiple outputs - Output: Uses .view{ it } to display results\n\n\n\nOne of the features of Nextflow is the ability to override parameters from the command line. We can change the greeting message without modifying the script:\npixi run nextflow run hello.nf -resume --greeting 'Bonjour le monde!'\n\n\n\nWe also worked with building our own nextflow pipelines for quality control of rna-seq data. The training included running FastQC and MultiQC on sample data:\n\n\n\nChannel Process FastQC\n\n\nFigure 2: Nextflow channel and process architecture for FastQC quality control. This diagram shows how input data flows through channels into FastQC processes. Each process can run independently while channels manage data flow between steps.\n\n\n\nFastQC Report - Sample 1 - Individual quality control report for gut sample 1\nFastQC Report - Sample 2 - Individual quality control report for gut sample 2\n\nMultiQC Report - Comprehensive report combining all QC metrics\n\nThese reports demonstrate: - FastQC analysis: Per-base quality scores, sequence composition, adapter contamination - MultiQC aggregation: Combined visualization of multiple samples\n\nEnd of Day 3!"

    "text": "Today we worked with Nextflow and workflow management.\n\n\n\nNextflow Overview\n\n\nFigure 1: Nextflow workflow management system overview. This diagram illustrates the core concepts of Nextflow including processes, channels, and how data flows through a computational pipeline.\n\n\nToday we ran our first Nextflow script:\n#!/usr/bin/env nextflow\n\nparams.greeting = 'Hello world!'\ngreeting_ch = Channel.of(params.greeting)\n\nprocess SPLITLETTERS {\n    input:\n    val x\n\n    output:\n    path 'chunk_*'\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    printf '$x' | split -b 6 - chunk_\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess CONVERTTOUPPER {\n    input:\n    path y\n\n    output:\n    stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    cat $y | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]' \n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n    letters_ch = SPLITLETTERS(greeting_ch)\n    results_ch = CONVERTTOUPPER(letters_ch.flatten())\n    results_ch.view{ it }\n}\nWhen we run this script:\nnextflow run hello.nf\nWe get this output:\nN E X T F L O W   ~  version 25.04.7\n\nLaunching `hello.nf` [jolly_faraday] DSL2 - revision: f5e335f983\n\nexecutor &gt;  local (3)\n[96/fd5f07] SPLITLETTERS (1)   [100%] 1 of 1 ✔\n[7e/dad424] CONVERTTOUPPER (2) [100%] 2 of 2 ✔\nHELLO \nWORLD!\nThis workflow demonstrates several key Nextflow concepts: - Channels: greeting_ch carries data between processes - SPLITLETTERS process: Uses split command to break text into 6-byte chunks - CONVERTTOUPPER process: Converts text to uppercase using tr command - Workflow: Connects processes with .flatten() to handle multiple outputs - Output: Uses .view{ it } to display results\n\n\n\nOne of the features of Nextflow is the ability to override parameters from the command line. We can change the greeting message without modifying the script:\npixi run nextflow run hello.nf -resume --greeting 'Bonjour le monde!'\n\n\n\nWe also worked with building our own nextflow pipelines for quality control of rna-seq data. The training included running FastQC and MultiQC on sample data:\n\n\n\nChannel Process FastQC\n\n\nFigure 2: Nextflow channel and process architecture for FastQC quality control. This diagram shows how input data flows through channels into FastQC processes. Each process can run independently while channels manage data flow between steps.\n\n\n\nFastQC Report - Sample 1 - Individual quality control report for gut sample 1\nFastQC Report - Sample 2 - Individual quality control report for gut sample 2\n\nMultiQC Report - Comprehensive report combining all QC metrics\n\nThese reports demonstrate: - FastQC analysis: Per-base quality scores, sequence composition, adapter contamination - MultiQC aggregation: Combined visualization of multiple samples\n\nEnd of Day 3!"
