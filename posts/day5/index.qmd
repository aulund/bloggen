# Day 5 of MedBioInfo

Day 5  we had an important discussion about AI in bioinformatics (actually the discussion were onday 4 because of us maxing out our allocated processing power on hp2nc and things were moved around) and a lecture + excerzises in data visualization with ggplot! 

## Today's Focus

Today we covered two topics:
- **Critical evaluation of AI in bioinformatics** - We talked about the benefits, risks, and responsible usage
- **Data visualization with ggplot** - Learning plottign in R

## Morning Session - AI in Bioinformatics

### The AI Revolution

In just 3 years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become mainstream. ChatGPT gained **100 million users in 2 months** after its 2022 release, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.

### Machine Learning in Bioinformatics - Historical Context

ML has been used in bioinformatics for decades:
- **Supervised learning** - Classification and regression on annotated data
- **Unsupervised learning** - Pattern discovery without human input
- **Applications** - Clustering, association, dimensionality reduction

GenAI represents the next evolutionary step in applying machine learning into our lives.

## Critical Issues with AI

### 1. Training Data Bias

AI models inherit biases from their training data:
- **Historical bias** - "History written by the winners"
- **Internet bias** - Unequal access and participation
- **Quality issues** - Not everyone contributes equally online

> AI is not trained to be wrong and will "happily hallucinate an answer" rather than admit uncertainty

### 2. Impact on Learning and Productivity

**Learning concerns:**
- 2025 study showed adults using ChatGPT for essays were consistently outperformed by those writing without AI
- Significantly lower brain engagement when using AI assistance

**Productivity paradox:**
- Study of experienced developers (5+ years) found AI tools actually reduced productivity
- Time spent on prompting, reviewing AI responses, and being idle
- Less time actually coding and problem-solving

### 3. Data Privacy and Legal Issues

**Critical concerns for bioinformatics:**
- Biological data is highly sensitive and often legally protected
- Terms of Service violations
- Copyright issues
- GDPR compliance

**Best practices:**
- Check Terms of Service explicitly and frequently
- Use GDPR-compliant tools when possible
- Share data descriptions, not actual datasets
- Be wary of browser extensions that steal personal data

### 4. Environmental Impact

**Resource consumption:**
- Data centers use more electricity than many countries
- Massive water requirements for cooling
- Built near poor communities, often draining local resources

### 5. Changing How We Communicate

AI is already changing language patterns:
- Words like "delve" and "meticulous" increasingly common in academic talks.
- Different AI models have distinct writing styles.
- 24% of internet content was AI-generated by end of 2023 from 2-3% in 2022.

## Responsible AI Usage Guidelines

### Questions to Ask Before Using AI:

1. Am I phrasing my prompt effectively?
2. Can I find this information another way?
3. How much time am I actually saving?
4. Do I know enough to identify AI errors?
5. What are the consequences of testing AI solutions?

## Afternoon Session - Data Visualization with ggplot

### Introduction to ggplot

After completing downstream analyses, visualization becomes crucial for:
- **Results presentation** - Making findings accessible
- **Pattern recognition** - Discovering insights in data
- **Communication** - Sharing discoveries with others

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is R's powerful visualization package, part of the tidyverse ecosystem.

### ggplot Capabilities

The package offers incredible versatility for creating:
- **Statistical plots** - Scatter plots, histograms, box plots
- **Multi-dimensional visualizations** - Faceting and grouping
- **Custom themes** - Professional publication-ready graphics
- **Interactive elements** - Enhanced user engagement

### Hands-on Practice

We worked through practical examples using the [NBIS tutorial by Roy Francis](https://nbisweden.github.io/raukr-2023/labs/ggplot/), covering:

```r
# Basic ggplot structure
library(ggplot2)

# Example scatter plot
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "My Analysis Results",
       x = "X-axis Label",
       y = "Y-axis Label")
```

![Basic scatter plot example](basic_scatter_plot.png){fig-alt="Basic scatter plot showing the relationship between two variables with minimal theme styling." width="70%"}

```r
# Advanced plotting with facets
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~category) +
  theme_bw()
```

![Faceted scatter plot with color grouping](faceted_scatter_plot.png){fig-alt="Advanced scatter plot with color grouping and faceting by category, demonstrating ggplot's layered approach." width="80%"}

### Key ggplot Concepts

- **Grammar of Graphics** - Systematic approach to building plots
- **Layered approach** - Adding elements incrementally
- **Aesthetic mappings** - Connecting data to visual properties
- **Geometric objects** - Points, lines, bars, etc.
- **Themes and styling** - Professional appearance
