# Day 5 of MedBioInfo

Day 5  we had an important discussion about AI in bioinformatics (actually the discussion were onday 4 because of us maxing out our allocated processing power on hp2nc and things were moved around) and a lecture + excerzises in data visualization with ggplot! 

## Today's Focus

Today we covered two important topics:
- **Critical evaluation of AI in bioinformatics** - We talked about the benefits, risks, and responsible usage
- **Data visualization with ggplot** - Learning plottign in R

### The AI Revolution

In just 3 years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become mainstream. ChatGPT gained **100 million users in 2 months** after its 2022 release, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.

Key AI developments:
- **Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs)** - The chatbots we know
- **Training on massive datasets** - Learning from internet-scale data
- **Task-specific training** - Customized through prompt engineering

### Machine Learning in Bioinformatics - Historical Context

ML has been used in bioinformatics for decades:
- **Supervised learning** - Classification and regression on annotated data
- **Unsupervised learning** - Pattern discovery without human input
- **Applications** - Clustering, association, dimensionality reduction

GenAI represents the next evolutionary step in applying ML to our lives.

## Critical Issues with AI

### 1. Training Data Bias

AI models inherit biases from their training data:
- **Historical bias** - "History written by the winners"
- **Internet bias** - Unequal access and participation
- **Quality issues** - Not everyone contributes equally online

> Problem: AI will "happily hallucinate an answer" rather than admit uncertainty

### 2. Impact on Learning and Productivity

**Learning concerns:**
- 2025 study showed adults using ChatGPT for essays were **consistently outperformed** by those writing without AI
- **Significantly lower brain engagement** when using AI assistance

**Productivity paradox:**
- Study of experienced developers (5+ years) found AI tools actually **reduced productivity**
- Time spent on prompting, reviewing AI responses, and being idle
- Less time actually coding and problem-solving

### 3. Data Privacy and Legal Issues

**Critical concerns for bioinformatics:**
- **Biological data is highly sensitive** - Often legally protected
- **Terms of Service violations** - Many users unknowingly share protected data
- **Copyright issues** - Legal battles over training data usage
- **GDPR compliance** - Need for compliant tools

**Best practices:**
- Check Terms of Service explicitly and frequently
- Use GDPR-compliant tools when possible
- Share data descriptions, not actual datasets
- Be wary of browser extensions that steal personal data

### 4. Environmental Impact

**Resource consumption:**
- Data centers use more electricity than many countries
- Massive water requirements for cooling
- Built near poor communities, often draining local resources

**Example:** Saying "please" and "thank you" to ChatGPT has cost OpenAI tens of millions in electricity costs.

### 5. Changing How We Communicate

AI is already changing language patterns:
- Words like "delve" and "meticulous" increasingly common in academic talks.
- Different AI models have distinct writing styles.
- 24% of internet content was AI-generated by end of 2023 from 2-3% in 2022.

## Responsible AI Usage Guidelines

### Questions to Ask Before Using AI:

1. **Am I phrasing my prompt effectively?**
2. **Can I find this information another way?**
3. **How much time am I actually saving?**
4. **Do I know enough to identify AI errors?**
5. **What are the consequences of testing AI solutions?**

### Key Principles:

- **Maintain curiosity** - Don't let AI replace your desire to learn
- **Seek explanations** - Understand what AI tells you
- **Validate independently** - Find expert sources to confirm
- **Active learning** - Use AI as a tool, not a replacement for thinking


## Afternoon Session - Data Visualization with ggplot

### Introduction to ggplot

After completing downstream analyses, visualization becomes crucial for:
- **Results presentation** - Making findings accessible
- **Pattern recognition** - Discovering insights in data
- **Communication** - Sharing discoveries with others

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is R's powerful visualization package, part of the tidyverse ecosystem.

### ggplot Capabilities

The package offers incredible versatility for creating:
- **Statistical plots** - Scatter plots, histograms, box plots
- **Multi-dimensional visualizations** - Faceting and grouping
- **Custom themes** - Professional publication-ready graphics
- **Interactive elements** - Enhanced user engagement

### Hands-on Practice

We worked through practical examples using the [NBIS tutorial by Roy Francis](https://nbisweden.github.io/raukr-2023/labs/ggplot/), covering:

```r
# Basic ggplot structure
library(ggplot2)

# Example scatter plot
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "My Analysis Results",
       x = "X-axis Label",
       y = "Y-axis Label")

# Advanced plotting with facets
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~category) +
  theme_bw()
```

### Example Visualizations

Here are some practical examples of ggplot2 in bioinformatics contexts:

#### 1. Differential Gene Expression Analysis (MA Plot)

```r
# Create MA plot for gene expression analysis
ggplot(gene_data, aes(x = avg_expression, y = log2_fold_change, color = significance)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Significant" = "#E31A1C", "Not Significant" = "#1F78B4")) +
  labs(title = "MA Plot: Gene Expression Analysis",
       subtitle = "Differential expression between control and treatment",
       x = "Average Expression (log2)",
       y = "Log2 Fold Change",
       color = "Statistical\nSignificance") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### 2. Quality Control Metrics with Faceting

```r
# Quality control visualization across different batches
qc_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gc_content, y = duplication_rate, color = batch, size = read_count/1000000)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~batch, ncol = 3) +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Read Count\n(Millions)", range = c(2, 8)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "Batch") +
  labs(title = "Quality Control Metrics Across Batches",
       subtitle = "GC content vs duplication rate, sized by read count",
       x = "GC Content (%)",
       y = "Duplication Rate (%)") +
  theme_bw()
```

#### 3. Time Series Analysis

```r
# Tracking sequencing run success over time
ggplot(time_data, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = successful_runs, color = "Successful"), linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = failed_runs, color = "Failed"), linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = successful_runs, color = "Successful"), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = failed_runs, color = "Failed"), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Successful" = "#2E8B57", "Failed" = "#DC143C")) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y", date_breaks = "2 months") +
  labs(title = "Sequencing Run Success Rate Over Time",
       subtitle = "Tracking laboratory performance throughout 2025",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Runs",
       color = "Run Status") +
  theme_minimal()
```
