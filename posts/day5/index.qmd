# Day 5 of MedBioInfo

Day 5 brought us an important discussion about AI in bioinformatics and hands-on data visualization with ggplot! A perfect combination of critical thinking and practical skills.

## Today's Focus

Today we covered two important topics:
- **Critical evaluation of AI in bioinformatics** - Understanding benefits, risks, and responsible usage
- **Data visualization with ggplot** - Learning R's powerful plotting capabilities

## Morning Session - AI in Bioinformatics

### The AI Revolution

In just 3 years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become mainstream. ChatGPT gained **100 million users in 2 months** after its 2022 release, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.

Key AI developments:
- **Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs)** - The chatbots we know
- **Training on massive datasets** - Learning from internet-scale data
- **Task-specific training** - Customized through prompt engineering

### Machine Learning in Bioinformatics - Historical Context

ML has been used in bioinformatics for decades:
- **Supervised learning** - Classification and regression on annotated data
- **Unsupervised learning** - Pattern discovery without human input
- **Applications** - Clustering, association, dimensionality reduction

GenAI represents the next evolutionary step in applying ML to our lives.

## Critical Issues with AI

### 1. Training Data Bias

AI models inherit biases from their training data:
- **Historical bias** - "History written by the winners"
- **Internet bias** - Unequal access and participation
- **Quality issues** - Not everyone contributes equally online

> Problem: AI will "happily hallucinate an answer" rather than admit uncertainty

### 2. Impact on Learning and Productivity

**Learning concerns:**
- 2025 study showed adults using ChatGPT for essays were **consistently outperformed** by those writing without AI
- **Significantly lower brain engagement** when using AI assistance

**Productivity paradox:**
- Study of experienced developers (5+ years) found AI tools actually **reduced productivity**
- Time spent on prompting, reviewing AI responses, and being idle
- Less time actually coding and problem-solving

### 3. Data Privacy and Legal Issues

**Critical concerns for bioinformatics:**
- **Biological data is highly sensitive** - Often legally protected
- **Terms of Service violations** - Many users unknowingly share protected data
- **Copyright issues** - Legal battles over training data usage
- **GDPR compliance** - Need for compliant tools

**Best practices:**
- Check Terms of Service explicitly and frequently
- Use GDPR-compliant tools when possible
- Share data descriptions, not actual datasets
- Be wary of browser extensions that steal personal data

### 4. Environmental Impact

**Resource consumption:**
- Data centers use more electricity than many countries
- Massive water requirements for cooling
- Built near poor communities, often draining local resources

**Example:** Saying "please" and "thank you" to ChatGPT has cost OpenAI tens of millions in electricity costs.

### 5. Changing How We Communicate

AI is already changing language patterns:
- Words like "delve" and "meticulous" increasingly common in academic talks
- Different AI models have distinct writing styles (idiolects)
- 24% of internet content was AI-generated by end of 2023 (up from 2-3% in 2022)

## Responsible AI Usage Guidelines

### Questions to Ask Before Using AI:

1. **Am I phrasing my prompt effectively?**
2. **Can I find this information another way?**
3. **How much time am I actually saving?**
4. **Do I know enough to identify AI errors?**
5. **What are the consequences of testing AI solutions?**

### Key Principles:

- **Maintain curiosity** - Don't let AI replace your desire to learn
- **Seek explanations** - Understand what AI tells you
- **Validate independently** - Find expert sources to confirm
- **Active learning** - Use AI as a tool, not a replacement for thinking

> **Remember:** You don't need AI. Before AI, you were perfectly capable of scientific work. Don't confuse convenience with need!

## Afternoon Session - Data Visualization with ggplot

### Introduction to ggplot

After completing downstream analyses, visualization becomes crucial for:
- **Results presentation** - Making findings accessible
- **Pattern recognition** - Discovering insights in data
- **Communication** - Sharing discoveries with others

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is R's powerful visualization package, part of the tidyverse ecosystem.

### ggplot Capabilities

The package offers incredible versatility for creating:
- **Statistical plots** - Scatter plots, histograms, box plots
- **Multi-dimensional visualizations** - Faceting and grouping
- **Custom themes** - Professional publication-ready graphics
- **Interactive elements** - Enhanced user engagement

### Hands-on Practice

We worked through practical examples using the [NBIS tutorial by Roy Francis](https://nbisweden.github.io/raukr-2023/labs/ggplot/), covering:

```r
# Basic ggplot structure
library(ggplot2)

# Example scatter plot
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "My Analysis Results",
       x = "X-axis Label",
       y = "Y-axis Label")

# Advanced plotting with facets
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2, color = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~category) +
  theme_bw()
```

### Key ggplot Concepts

- **Grammar of Graphics** - Systematic approach to building plots
- **Layered approach** - Adding elements incrementally
- **Aesthetic mappings** - Connecting data to visual properties
- **Geometric objects** - Points, lines, bars, etc.
- **Themes and styling** - Professional appearance

## Insights and Connections

### AI and Scientific Integrity

> "As scientists, we know we should use peer-reviewed resources. GPTs have been widely shown to fabricate citations."

The discussion highlighted how AI challenges traditional scientific methodology:
- **Verification burden** - Every AI-generated citation must be checked
- **Personal responsibility** - Users liable for AI-generated content
- **Quality vs. speed** - Balancing efficiency with accuracy

### Visualization as Communication

Data visualization serves as the bridge between complex analyses and understanding:
- **Makes patterns visible** that might be hidden in raw data
- **Enables hypothesis generation** through visual exploration
- **Facilitates scientific communication** across disciplines

## Comparison with Previous Days

- **Day 1**: Data management and FAIR principles â†’ Foundation for trustworthy research
- **Day 2**: Environments and quality control â†’ Technical reliability
- **Day 3**: Nextflow and workflow management â†’ Computational reproducibility  
- **Day 4**: nf-core pipelines and RNAseq â†’ Production bioinformatics
- **Day 5**: AI ethics and visualization â†’ Responsible analysis and communication

## Key Takeaways

### AI in Bioinformatics
- **Critical evaluation** is essential - don't use AI as a black box
- **Understand limitations** - bias, hallucinations, environmental cost
- **Maintain agency** - preserve your ability to think and learn
- **Data protection** - be extremely careful with sensitive biological data

### Data Visualization
- **ggplot mastery** opens powerful communication possibilities
- **Grammar of graphics** provides systematic approach to visualization
- **Practice essential** - hands-on experience builds intuition

## Questions for Further Exploration

1. How can we develop institutional policies for responsible AI use in research?
2. What visualization techniques best serve different types of biological data?
3. How do we balance AI efficiency with scientific rigor and learning?

## Looking Ahead
