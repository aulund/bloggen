# Day 2 of MedBioInfo


## Today's Focus

Today we covered four main topics:
- Introduction to environments
- Quality control with Pixi and Slurm
- Introduction to containers  
- Quality control with containers

## Introduction to Environments
-Since I work with variant visualisations, large datasets, and a mix of custom scripts and publication-ready figures it’s important that my toolchain is reproducible.  
-Pixi keeps everything isolated and version-controlled, so I don’t end up with “it works on my computer” issues.
 -A dedicated environment for each project makes it easier to share with others to get the same exact tools and versions as when i made the analysis. 
-When I prepare figures or analyses for papers, Pixi can help me keep track of software versions, channels, and dependencies.
-Pixi supports multiple platforms and I can test everything locally and then run it on the cluster.



## Quality Control with Pixi and Slurm

- Quality control is one of the most important parts of bioinformatics.
- If the sequencing data is bad, everything that comes after will be unreliable.
- Running FastQC and MultiQC early on saves time later.
- Having a clear directory structure and running everything inside a controlled environment like Pixi keeps track of what was actually done.
- Working with SLURM and screen was a bit difficult at first, but it's useful to understand how jobs run on the cluster


##  Introduction to Containers

-Lack of reproducibility is a common problem in bioinformatics. 
-Containers make it more manageable. They keep analyses stable even when systems or dependencies change. 
-It’s also a practical way to share workflows without needing to explain every installation step.
