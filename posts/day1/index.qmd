# Welcome to Day 1

This is my first blog post! Here are my reflections and notes from day 1.

## What I Learned Today

- How to set up a Quarto blog
- The importance of YAML frontmatter
- How to write content in Markdown

## Sample Code

Here's a simple example:

```{python}
# A simple Python example
greeting = "Hello, world!"
print(greeting)

# Some basic math
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print(f"The sum is: {total}")
```

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I plan to:

1. Explore more Quarto features
2. Add some visualizations
3. Learn about themes and styling

That's all for today!
